      question: "What is DogevsPepe?",
      answer: `DogevsPepe is a crypto presale with a twist. It’s a competition between two iconic memes, Doge and Pepe, to determine which one escapes the matrix and launches as a live cryptocurrency. Investors choose their side by purchasing tokens for either team (or both!), and the team with the most funds raised wins.`,
    },
    {
      question: "How does the presale work?",
      answer: `
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 md:pl-8 text-white space-y-2">
          <li>Choose your champion: Team Doge (Orange Coin) or Team Pepe (Green Coin).</li>
          <li>Buy tokens to support your chosen team(s).</li>
          <li>When the combined presale total hits $1 million, the team with the most funds raised is declared the winner.</li>
        </ul>
      `,
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to the losing team’s funds?",
      answer:
        "The losing team’s funds are added to the liquidity pool of the winning token, boosting its value and ensuring a strong market launch. This means even if your team doesn’t win, your investment contributes to the success of the overall project.",
    },
    {
      question: "How Many Times Can I Buy?",
      answer:
        "You can buy as many times as you like, however each singular purchase is capped at a maximum of $10,000 to ensure fair participation and prevent any one person from dominating the presale.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I invest in both teams?",
      answer:
        "Yes! You can support both Doge and Pepe by purchasing tokens for both teams. However, only one will win, so choose wisely!",
    },
    {
      question: "Is the presale fair and secure?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Both presale contracts are public and fully transparent, so you can see how funds are being allocated.",
    },
    {
      question: "When does the winning token launch?",
      answer:
        "The winning token launches within 24 hours of the presale goal being reached. This means no long waits—your investment goes to work almost immediately.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I track the progress of the presale?",
      answer:
        "Live stats will be displayed on the website, showing how much each team has raised. Stay connected to see if your team is leading the charge!",
